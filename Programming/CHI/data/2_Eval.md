## User Interface Evaluation Definition

Based on cognitive psychology, we try to identify potential problems.

```mermaid
graph LR
	A((Cognitive Psycology)) --> B(Human Intelligence)
    A --> C(Language)
    A --> D(Thinking & Problem Solving)
    A --> E(Memory)
    A --> F(Attention)
    A --> G(Perception)
```

## Steps

First identify a usability criteria (heuristics) and then study them.
Some common heuristics are:
- System behaviour is predictable.
- System behaviour is consistent.
- Feedback is provided.
