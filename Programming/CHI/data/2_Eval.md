# GUI Evaluation

[Back to index](/Programming/CHI/CHI.md)

## Definition

Based on cognitive psychology, we try to identify potential problems.

    A --> D(Thinking & Problem Solving)
    A --> E(Memory)
    A --> F(Attention)
    A --> G(Perception)
```

First identify a usability criteria (heuristics) and then study them.
Some common heuristics are:
- System behaviour is predictable.
- System behaviour is consistent (use conventions).
- Feedback is provided.
- System uses "real world" language.
- User control and freedom (undo & redo)
- Error prevention.

A review-based evaluation relies on experimental results and empirical evidence.

## Types of Evaluation

- **Observational methods:**
	- **Think aloud**. Users are asked to describe what they do and why.
	- **Cooperative evaluation**. Users and evaluator ask questions to each other.
	- **Protocol analysis**. Requires expert analysis of means of recording.
	- **Automated analysis**. Videotaping with automated annotation/response (quantitative).
	- **Post-talk walkthroughs**. Recording is played back to participants for comments.
- **Query techniques:**
	- **Interviews**. List of questions asked to the user one-to-one.
	- **Questionnaires**. List of questions to the users (less personal).
- **Physiological methods:**
	- Eye tracking.
	- Physiological measurements
