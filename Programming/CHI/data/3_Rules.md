# Golden rules of UI design

[Back to index](/Programming/CHI/CHI.md)

---

## 1. Strive for consistency

- Follow the *Principle of Least Surprise*
- Consistent sequences of actions are repeated in similar situations.
- Example. Same terminology, color, layout, fonts...
## 2. Seek universal usability

- Recognise the needs of diverse users and designed for all of them.
- Examples:
	- Add explanations for novices.
	- Add shortcuts for experts.

## 3. Offer informative feedback

- There is feedback for every action.
	- Modest for frequent/minor actions.
	- Substantial for infrequent/major actions.
## 4. Design dialogs to yield closure

- Sequences of actions are organized into groups.
	- There is a beginning, middle and end.
	- Feedback at the completion of a group.
	- Example. Select product -> Checkout -> Confirmation

## 5. Prevent errors

- Design to avoid serious errors.
- When made, provide simple, constructive and specific instructions for recovery.

## 6. Permit easy reversal of actions

- Actions should be reversible.
## 7. Keep users in control

- Interface should respond to the user actions.
- Avoid surprises or changes in familiar behaviour.

## 8. Reduce short-term memory load
