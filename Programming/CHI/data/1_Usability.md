## Definition

- Usability is how well users can use the systemâ€™s functionality.
- Usability is about creating effective user interfaces
- There are 5 dimensions (LESEL):
	- Learnability
	- Efficiency
	- Safety
	- Ergonomics
	- Look & Feel

## Learnability

- Measures how easy is for an user to learn.
- A quantity measure is how long does it take to become an expert.
- Good practices:
	- Use widespread metaphors and names.
	- Actions must be immediately visible, incremental and reversible.

## Efficiency

- Measures how fast it is to use once learned.
- A quantity measure is how many task an expert can perform per time.
- Good practices:
	- Define keyboard shortcuts (easy memorable key combinations).
	- Use accelerators (shortcuts that trigger the effect in the menu-bar or a button)
	- Use visible buttons/icons (make not visible )

## Safety

- Measures if there are few and recoverable errors.

## Ergonomics

- Confort, fatigue

## Look & Feel

- Feelings caused by the interface
