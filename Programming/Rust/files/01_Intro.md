## Compiler
A rust file (`.rs`) can be compiled with the command `rustc my_program.rs` 
Then a binarie `my_program.exe`in windows or `my_program` in linux will be created.
It can be executed with `.\my_program.exe` in windows or `./my_program` in linux.

## Cargo
Cargo is Rustâ€™s build system and package manager.
- The version installed can be checked: `cargo --version`
- To create a new project: `cargo new my_project`
- To build the project: `cargo build`
- To run the project (will also buid if needed): `cargo run`
- To check if the program compiles without actually doing it: `cargo check`
