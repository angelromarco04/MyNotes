## Event Driven Programming (EDP)
### Definition
The execution flow of the program varies depending on some events.
### State in EDP
- The program state is difficult to determine.
- There are usually concurrent (parallel) programs.
- There are several modules:
	- Can run a different speeds.
	- Can run simultaneously.
	- Some can not necessarily run.
	- Can have several instances running.
### Events in EDP
- Events are an observable occurrence.
- Events can happen at any instant.
- Events can be external or internal.
