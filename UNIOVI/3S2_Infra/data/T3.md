## Introduction
- Options for permanent storage.
	- Hard Drive Disk (HDD) - magnetic
	- CD/DVD - optic
	- Solid State Drive - flash memory
- Usecases
	- Desktop computer. Looks for simplicity, usually a single disk.
	- Server storage
		- Looks for high capacity, high performance, fault tolerant and high availability.
		- Multiple disks managed by a controller

## Storage organization in the computer
### Connection hierarchy of modern computers

- The hub/bridge is also called concentrator subsystem or chipset
- Each bus has three lines and used only 1 simultaneously
	- Address line. Contains the memory location of the accessed device.
	- Control line. Contains the actual data.
	- Data line. Carries control signals (R/W)
- Bus controller alternatives
	- Bus controller in motherboard
		- Controller integrated in the chipset or connected to a motherboard bus.
		- A I/O bus can be connected to the controler.
	- Bus controller in HBA
		- Motherboard bus provides an expansion slot.
		- A bus controller Host Bus Adapter (HBA)
### I/O Buses
#### ATA (Advanced Technology Attachment)
#### SCSI (Small Computer System Interface)
#### SATA (Serial ATA)
#### SAS (Serial Attached SCSI)
### NVMe
