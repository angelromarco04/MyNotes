## Introduction
- Options for permanent storage.
	- Hard Drive Disk (HDD) - magnetic
	- CD/DVD - optic
	- Solid State Drive - flash memory
- Use cases
	- Desktop computer. Looks for simplicity, usually a single disk.
	- Server storage
		- Looks for high capacity, high performance, fault tolerant and high availability.
		- Multiple disks managed by a controller

## Connection hierarchy of modern computers
![[../assets/connectionHierarchy.png]]
- The hub/bridge is also called concentrator subsystem or chipset
- Each bus has three lines and used only 1 simultaneously
	- Address line. Contains the memory location of the accessed device.
	- Control line. Contains the actual data.
	- Data line. Carries control signals (R/W)
- Bus controller alternatives
	- Bus controller in motherboard
		- Controller integrated in the chipset or connected to a motherboard bus.
		- A I/O bus can be connected to the controler.
	- Bus controller in HBA
		- Motherboard bus provides an expansion slot.
		- A bus controller (Host Bus Adapter - HBA) can be connected.

## I/O Buses
### Introduction
- Standardisation
	- Allows integration between different manufacturers
	- Standards created by groups of manufacturers such as INCITS
- Bus standard features
	- Physical features
	- Logic architecture
	- Programming interface
### Parallel Buses
- **Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA)**
	- Developed by Western Digital
	- 7 versions from ATA-1 to ATA-7
	- Better bandwidth: 113.3 MB/s (ATA-7)
- **Small Computer System Interface (SCSI)**
	- 9 versions from SCSI-1 to ULTRA320 SCSI
	- Better bandwidth: 320 MB/s (ULTRA320-SCSI)

| Bus name    | # of lines | # devices                | Scope of use                      |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| ATA         | 16 bits    | 1 master + 1 slave       | Personal computers                |
| Narrow SCSI | 8 bits     | 1 controller + 7 devices | Server & external storage systems |
| Wide SCSI   | 16 bits    | 1 controller +15 devices | Server & external storage systems |
### Serial Buses Description
- Performance
	- Parallel bus have better width while serial has better frequency.
	- Parallel buses have a limited frequency (electromagnetic noise)
	- This restriction is more significant as the bus length increases.
- Used space (footprint)
	- Serial wires are narrower and take less space .
	- Serial communication requires fewer conductors and pins.
