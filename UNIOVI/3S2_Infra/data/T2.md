## Introduction
- Computer systems present a layered structure:
```mermaid
graph BT
    A[Physical platform] -->|physical resources| B[Operating System]
    B -->|logical resources| C[Application]
```
- Virtualization = **modified view** of resources that one layer provides to its upper layer
- We consider a new layer in between called the **virtualization layer**.

## Resource virtualization
- Modified view of a physical resource
- Virtualization layer can be:
	- In the **Physical Platform** (By hardware)
		- Disk virtualization through a RAID controller (firmware)
	- In the **Operating System** (By software)
