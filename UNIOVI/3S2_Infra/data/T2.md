## Introduction
- Computer systems present a layered structure:
```mermaid
graph BT
    A[Physical platform] -->|physical resources| B[Operating System]
    B -->|logical resources| C[Application]
```
- Virtualization = **modified view** of resources that one layer provides to its upper layer
- We consider a new layer in between called the **virtualization layer**.
---
## Resource virtualization
- Modified view of a physical resource
- Virtualization layer can be:
	- In the **Physical Platform** (By hardware)
		- Disk virtualization through a physical RAID controller
		- Virtualization layer in the controller firmware
	- In the **Operating System** (By software)
		- Main memory virtualization through the virtual memory
		- Virtualization layer in the OS memory management subsystem
---
## Platform virtualization
- Mechanism for generating virtual execution platforms
- To avoid OS modification, they adapt to virtual platforms through drivers
- Now a single server hosts multiple servers
- Method to void server proliferation (are expensive and have low utilization)
### Type 1 - Native or Bare-metal
- Virtualization layer directly on top of the physical platform
- Two types:
	- Microkernel architecture
		- Examples. Xen or Hyper-V
		- It is a minimal kernel (1MB) that manages processor, memory and interruptions.
		- There is a privileged machine that:
			- Manages I/O operations
			- Manages VMs with a management tool
	- Monolithic
