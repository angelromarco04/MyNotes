## Introduction
- Computer systems present a layered structure:
```mermaid
graph BT
    A[Physical platform] -->|physical resources| B[Operating System]
    B -->|logical resources| C[Application]
```
- Virtualization = **modified view** of resources that one layer provides to its upper layer
- We consider a new layer in between called the **virtualization layer**.

## Resource virtualization
- Modified view of a physical resource
- Virtualization layer can be:
	- In the **Physical Platform** (By hardware)
		- Disk virtualization through a physical RAID controller
		- Virtualization layer in the controller firmware
	- In the **Operating System** (By software)
		- Main memory virtualization through the virtual memory
		- Virtualization layer in the OS memory management subsystem

## Platform virtualization
- Mechanism for generating virtual execution platforms
- To avoid OS modification, they adapt to virtual platforms through drivers
- Objectives
	- Avoid server proliferation (low utilization, acqu)
