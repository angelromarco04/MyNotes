## Socket creation
### General
- A socket is an abstraction that allows to ignore the details of transport and network layers.
- Each socket has a "name" that is a pair of IP and port.
- Two types of sockets:
	- Connection oriented: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
	- Datagram oriented (Connectionless): User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- In `C` we need the following libraries
	- `sys/socket.h` contains the functions  (`socket`, `bind`... ).
	- `netinet/in.h` contains:
		- Main structures (`sockaddr_in`)
		- Constants (`INADDR_ANY`, `INADDR_LOOPBACK`, `INADDR_BROADCAST`...)
		- Byte conversion (network always use big endian / IPs has 4B and ports 2B)
			- `htonl()` (host to network large): 4 host bytes to big endian
			- `htons()` (host to network small): 2 host bytes to big endian
			- `ntohl()` (network to host large): 4 big endian bytes to host
			- `ntohs()` (network to host small): 2 big endian bytes to host
### TCP Sockets
1. Create a pasive socket to wait for requests
	```
	int passive_socket = socket(PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, 0);
	```
	- `PF_INET` for IPv4
	- `SOCK_STREAM` for TCP connections
