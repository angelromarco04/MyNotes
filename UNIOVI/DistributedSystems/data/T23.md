## Local Calls vs. Remote Calls
- Local calls
	- One single process
	- Not necc
- Remote calls involve two processes, need machine location, type checking, and cannot pass arguments by reference.

**Key Ideas in RPC:**
- **Stubs**: Functions for interaction at the message level.
  - Client stub: Sends parameters and waits for the response.
  - Server stub: Waits for connections, reads messages, invokes the function, and sends the result back.

**RPC Implementation Details:**
- Client and server stubs handle encoding/decoding and network communication.
- Example programs and pseudocode illustrate both local and remote calls.

**Asynchronous RPCs:**
- Allows the client to continue working without waiting for the response.

**Problems and Solutions in ONC RPC:**
- **Parameter coding**: Using XDR.
- **Interface specification**: Using IDL.
- **Service location**: Using portmapper.
- **Code generation**: Using rpcgen.

**Interface Specification:**
- Specified in a specific language (.x file), declaring parameters, result types, and services offered by RPC.

**Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation):**
- Object-oriented equivalent of RPC.
- Remote classes implement methods, with stubs and skeletons handling communication.
- Requires a registry for client-server connection.

This document provides detailed examples and pseudocode for implementing and understanding RPC and Java RMI in distributed systems.
