# Information format (XDR)
---
## XDR Usage
- Encoding is always done in Big Endian
- Always in a multiple of 4 Bytes
- Non-primal 
### XDR Sender
- Opens file as `r`
- Creates operation as `XDR_ENCODE`
```C
XDR operation;

// File to send (similar to descriptor)
FILE *file;
file = fopen("data.xdr", "w"); // Open to write
if (file == NULL) exit (EXIT_ERROR)

// Creates the operation to ENCODE
xdrstdio_create(&operation, file, XDR_ENCODE);

// Operations
xdr_MyType(&operation, &data); // Value of data encoded to file
// By default: xdr_int, xdr_char, xdr_float, xdr_bool

xdr_destroy(&operation); // Destroy the variable operation
fclose(file); // Close the file
```
### XDR Receiver
- Opens file as `w`
- Creates operation as `XDR_DECODE`
```C
XDR operation;

// File to send (similar to descriptor)
FILE *file;
file = fopen("data.xdr", "r"); // Open to read
if (file == NULL) exit (EXIT_ERROR)

// Creates the operation to DECODE
xdrstdio_create(&operation, file, XDR_DECODE);

// Operations
xdr_MyType(&operation, &data); // Value of data decoded from file
// By default: xdr_int, xdr_char, xdr_float, xdr_bool

xdr_destroy(&operation); // Destroy the variable operation
fclose(file); // Close the file
```
