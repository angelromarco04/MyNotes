---
## Introduction
- Software required to manage virtual memory (part of the OS).
### Reading policies
- When do we need to load a page to MM?
- **On Demand Paging**
	- Pages are loaded to MM when referenced by the CPU
	- Principle of locality reduces page faults.
	- On Pure Demanding Paging processes start with no page at MM.
- **Previous Paging**
	- More than one page loaded in a single page fault.
	- This was never proven.
### Location Policies
- Where do we need to load a page to MM?
- For paging location is not important.
