## Reading Policies
When do we need to load a page to MM?
### On Demand Paging

- Pages are loaded to MM when referenced by the CPU
- Principle of locality reduces page faults.
- On Pure Demanding Paging processes start with no page at MM.
### Previous Paging
- More than one page loaded in a single page fault.
- This was never proven.
