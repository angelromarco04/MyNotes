## Naming

- Files are a abstraction mechanism
	- Way of storing and reading information.
	- Simplification for the user.
- Whenever a process creates a file it assigns it a name
	- Other processes can access it through that name.
	- Name varies depending on the OS.

---
## Logical structure of files 

- OS only sees a unstructured sequence of bytes.
- Internal structure is imposed by user processes.

---
## File types

- Regular files
	- ASCII/text
	- Binaries
		- The internal structure is known by the process using it.
		- If that process is the OS the binary is called executable.
