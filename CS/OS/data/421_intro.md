## Problem with Real Memory

- With real memory scheme:
	- Processes must be completely loaded in MM.
	- We do not need the whole program in MM.
- To partially load processes have some advantages:
	- Allowance to run programs greater in size than MM.
	- More programs can be in MM.
		- Increases multiprogramming level.
		- Switching operations are less expensive.
