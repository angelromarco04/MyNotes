## Introduction
### Ways to Manage Memory
- **Real memory**
	- Whole process is loaded to MM.
	- Low multiprogramming.
	- Can be contiguous allocated or not.
- **Virtual memory**
	- Processes are partially loaded to MM.
	- Higher multiprogramming.
	- Uses secondary memory as backup.
### History
1. Real memory
	1. Contiguous Allocation
		1. Single-process monitor
		2. Multi-programmed systems
			1. With fixed partitions
			2. With dynamic partitions
	2. Non-contiguous allocation
		1. Simple paging
		2. Simple segmentation
		3. Paged segmentation
2. Virtual memory
	1. Paging on-demand
	2. Segmentation on-demand. ÔÅÆ Paged segmentation.
