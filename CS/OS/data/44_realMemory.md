## Introduction
There are several ways to manage the memory
- **Real memory**
	- Whole process is loaded to MM.
	- Low multiprogramming.
	- Can be contiguous allocated or not.
- **Virtual memory**
	- Processes are partially loaded to MM.
	- Higher multiprogramming.
	- Uses secondary memory as backup.
