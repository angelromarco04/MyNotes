## Introduction
### Ways to Manage Memory
- **Real memory**
	- Whole process is loaded to MM.
	- Low multiprogramming.
	- Can be contiguous allocated or not.
- **Virtual memory**
	- Processes are partially loaded to MM.
	- Higher multiprogramming.
	- Uses secondary memory as backup.
### Historical Evolution
1. Real memory
	1. Contiguous Allocation
		1. Single-process monitor
		2. Multi-programmed systems
			1. With fixed partitions
			2. With dynamic partitions
	2. Non-contiguous allocation
		1. Simple paging
		2. Simple segmentation
		3. Paged segmentation
2. Virtual memory
	1. Paging on-demand
	2. Segmentation on-demand
	3. Paged segmentation.

## Contiguous memory allocation
### Singe-process monitor (OS)
#### Physical organization of the MM
- OS present at lower positions
- The only process is stored before the OS in the transient area.
- Processes life cycle: One stops -> It is removed -> Load another.
#### Protection
- Base register contains the initial physical address of the process in MM.
- Limit register contains the process size (in bytes).
- Process cannot access any logical address greater than the limit register.
- Every address generated by the CPU is checked.
#### Translation Steps
1. We have a logical address generated by the CPU.
2. Protection:  $\text{Logical address} > \text{Limit register} \implies \text{Exception}$
3. Translation: $\text{Logical address} + \text{Base register} = \text{Physical Address}$
4. We have a physical address
