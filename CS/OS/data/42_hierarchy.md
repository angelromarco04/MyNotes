## Introduction to Memory Hierarchy
### Hierarchy
1. CPU registers
2. Cache memory
3. Main Memory (MM)
4. Disk Cache
5. Magnetic disk
6. Magnetic tape â€“ Optic disk
## Characteristics
From top (1) to bottom (6):
- Cost decreases (per bit).
- Capacity increases.
- Access time increases.
- CPU access frequency decreases.
---
## Principle of Locality
- Memory accesses tend to be to adjacent positions.
	- Sequential programs, iterative structures, vectors...
- When an address is accessed it is probable that it will be accessed again.
- +performance = less access to lower
